# Workflow Automation Updates

## Background

While working with manufacturing, there was feedback on the many manual steps for preparing the compute node to run RackHD.  The BMC username and password is one of the manual steps that can be automated.



## Goals

* Add support to the Discovery workflow for automatically setting the BMC username and password.
* Update the Nodeâ€™s OBM settings with the set username and password.
* Create a RackHD workflow to set the BMC username and password.
