# V1.1 API Authentication

- (accepted)

(from ORFS-132)

## Background

The API's supported by RackHD support SSL, but currently offer nothing for verifying who's access them (authentication/authorization). We need to add a basic authN mechanism to the APIs for RackHD, such that if enabled and the correct authentication is provided, the APIs will return a 401 Forbidden response.

Discussions with the BOSH team (doing alpha proving now with RackHD tech stack) indicate that they're interested in a future integration with Pivotal's OAuth2 provider UAA (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa), although it's not clear when they will need that or if it would be a good general choice. In order to have something as a placeholder, some basic authentication mechanism (a header based token that has to match a configured value) is probably a sufficient first-cut for RackHD authentication, and using that to work out how to add a more general authentication/authorization layer if desired (as a configurable thing) would be intended as follow-on work.


## Goals

- With a configuration file setting, have the RackHD "northbound" API support a basic, "header token" authentication, validating the token against a value provided in the configuration
 - Leo_Question: With configuration file mechanism, does that mean we need to support RackHD (aka Monorail) API with authentication/authorization feature and original non-auth API at same time? Currently OnRack API only support authentication/authorization API interface.
   - heckj: The desire is to provide the RackHD API's (within on-http) with a simple authentication mechanism that can be enabled separately from OnRack. For example, enable a value in the the monorail.json configuration file, and all the RackHD API's that are available on port 8080 would now need to include a token in the header or the response should be an HTTP 401 unauthorized.

 - Leo_Question: Specific for configuration file setting, I assume it means static file which only take effective during RackHD startup, not request to provide API to allow user to pass certain configuration file in and then enable authentication/authorization feature in run time, is that correct?
   - heckj: that is correct. Configured at startup, not dynamically configurable through API calls

- The RackHD should be able to be deployed both with and without this authentication header (i.e the configuration either way)

 - Leo_Question: same question as above. Does this imply to support both interface (authentication and non-auth) at same time.
   - heckj: Not at the same time, but either on or off, based on what's in the configuration file

- The failed response for an AuthN failure should be a 401 response code (HTTP standard)
- The southbound API needs to be either updated or broken apart into a separate HTTP endpoint that's listening for task/bootstrap.js interactions and does not have to have authentication at this time.
 - Leo_Question: What does "southbound API" mean here? I assume it doesn't mean "Monorail API" but refer to "entity" interfacing to hardware component, for example, http/pxe, is it correct?
    - heckj: the APIs that we use to communicate to the iPXE process and the bootstrap scripts - meaning /profiles /templates and /tasks (there may be others) need to be able to operate independently of the user oriented REST APIs in term of authentication. In particular, iPXE doesn't send HTTP headers and would not be able to request an "authenticated" iPXE script for it's use (the /profiles call), nor do standard installers (such as kickstart or debseed) add authentication onto their requests, so adding authentication to "/templates" call would break that usage as well. The need is for the the user APIs.

 - Leo_Question: From feature delivery perspective, does what "OnRack API Authentication/Authorization - 0.3.0" has been done satisfy overall goal here so that we can follow some of design (obtain token, default users, query parameter/token, ..) for this functional spec?
   - heckj: for our purposes, nothing - it's a separate layer of authentication that's used for OnRack API's specifically, and doesn't provide any authentication to RackHD APIs. We want to enable authentication independently so that a standalone RackHD technology stack can support a basic concept of authenticated APIs.

 - if a user/password pair is used for an initial authentication mechanism, any "password" for a user/password combination for authentication to the RackHD APIs should be stored as a hashed value in monorail.json, using a key derivation function (like PBKDF2)
